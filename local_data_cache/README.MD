## Local copies of WI Election files

This folder contains local cached copies of WI election data,
from http://elections.wi.gov and http://www.gab.wi.gov/ (former location).

This is useful for testing parser.py (in the parent directory),
without requesting the input files via http every time.

fetch.py (now in parent directory) can be used to update the local cache.
